    <h2>Korean Style BBQ</h2>
    <p>Literally speaking, bulgogi (불고기) means “fire meat”.  It is often made with tender parts of beef, pork or chicken. However, in general terms, unless specified, bulgogi is made with beef.</p>
    <p>Undoubtedly it is one of the most well-known Korean traditional foods and it has been around for thousands of years. Naturally, the cooking method of bulgogi evolved over time and it varies by region too.</p>
    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>1 ¼ pounds boneless beef short ribs, sliced across the grain in 1/8-inch thick slices</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely crushed</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated gingerroot</li>

        <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Asian pear</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for brushing skillet</li>
        <li>2 cups hot steamed rice, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 sliced green onion tops for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>Instructions
        <li>Mix garlic, grated onion, grated ginger, toasted sesame oil, and brown sugar together in a mixing bowl. Stir in grated pear, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Transfer meat to marinade and toss to coat on all sides. Cover and refrigerate, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Season meat with salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil. Toss.</li>
        <li>Brush a cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil and place over high heat.

Serve over hot rice and top with green onion slices.</li>
